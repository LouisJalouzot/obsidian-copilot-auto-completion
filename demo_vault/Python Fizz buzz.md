Fizz buzz is often used as an interview problem to test if an applicant has basic programming knowledge. For a give `n`, the program should print the number between `1` and `n`. If the i-th number is divisible by three, it is replaced by `fizz`. If the number is divisible by five, it should print `buzz`. If the number is divisible by both, it should print `fizz buzz`.

In Python, you can implement it as follows:
```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> None:
